# Word Counter Website

This project is my first React application, designed to help users quickly analyse and manipulate text. It provides several useful features, including word count, character count, text transformation, reading time estimation, and a preview of the modified text.

Features
* Word Count: Displays the total number of words in the input text.
* Character Count: Shows the total number of characters (including spaces) in the input text.
* Convert to Uppercase: Transforms the text to uppercase.
* Convert to Lowercase: Transforms the text to lowercase.
* Capitalized Case: Converts the text to capitalized case (first letter of each word is capitalized).
* Reading Time Estimate: Estimates how long it would take to read the input text, based on an average reading speed.
* Preview Text: Displays a preview of the text after the selected transformation has been applied.
Technologies Used
* React (for building the user interface)
* JavaScript (for functionality)
* CSS (for styling)
How to Use
* Enter your text in the text area.
* Choose the desired transformation (uppercase, lowercase, etc.).
* The word count, character count, and estimated reading time will update automatically.
* The transformed text will appear in the preview section.
